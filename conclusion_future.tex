\section{Conclusion}
\hspace{0.9cm} The project's concept mainly includes the prediction of churn in telecom industry. To acheive the main goal of this project, we had planned to use GPU acceleration on large datasets and convert the textual data into an image format data. The idea of this project is implemented in MATLAB.The converted dataset is then fed into the Neural Network which is built using the feature of MATLAB's Neural Network Toolkit.\\ We effectively developed a better way to pre-process data so as to improve performance of processing data for the GPU.

\section{Future Scope}
\hspace{0.9cm} This definitely will give better results as compared to execution on a CPU. Training is many times faster on a GPU as compared to a CPU. This is evidenced in many papers published earlier. Future scope and work can be expanded to actually implementing the Neural Network on the GPU.
