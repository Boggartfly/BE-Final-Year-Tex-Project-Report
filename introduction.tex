\hspace{0.9cm} The concept of our project is to build a churn model which helps in predicting whether a user may churn or not i.e the user changes or leaves the existing service provider. Project is implemented in Matlab as it allows for rapid prototyping. Churn modelling requires computing of large datasets. Our project mainly focuses on computing these large data sets with the help of GPU acceleration.

Our technique lies in the paper presented by Sane and Agrawal \cite{citation-8}. We convert the textual data into an image using Min-Max normalisation as described in the paper cited above. This conversion is an intermediate step which helps us feed data into the neural network. As mentioned the main highlight exists in preprocessing the data for predictive analysis \cite{citation-1}.

\section{Background}

\hspace{0.9cm} As we can see in \cite{citation-1} churn ananlysis and prediction is a big part of managing customer relationships. The idea behind this project was to fundamentally increase the efficiency of this analysis process by introducing the concept of Prism. The concept of Prism is to split the data and perform analysis on it parallely on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). This decreases the time spent on analysing and executing neural networks by putting them on a GPU.

\section{Objective}

\hspace{0.9cm} Objective of the project is to demonstrate a significant speedup in execution time of analysis of data sets on Neural Networks.

\section{Purpose, Scope and applicability}

\hspace{0.9cm} Purpose, Scope and Applicability are important parameters to be discussed to give a definite direction to the project. They are described briefly as follows:

\subsection{Purpose}

\hspace{0.9cm} The project aims to provide a way to analyse your dataset faster than ever before by cutting down time required by graphics accerelation via GPU compute technology.

\subsection{Scope}

\hspace{0.9cm} The scope of the project is to clean,extract and transform datasets to implement on a Neural Network.

\subsection{Applicability}

\hspace{0.9cm} Applicabilty of done work is universal in the sense that data is independent of language. As long as the dataset under consideration is numeric, the technique is applicable.
